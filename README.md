# K-means-clustering-project

### Introduction
In this project, I will use K-Means Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public. K-Means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. Even though I have labelled data (the variable 'Private') in this dataset, it will be dropped before model fitting.
